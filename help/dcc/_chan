### -chan
     this removes ALL information about a channel from the bot, it's not
     made permanent unless a channel-file has been defined in the user
     file, then it's saved each time the usefile is, or by using .chansave
     
     *** IMPORTANT ***
     
     this erases ALL information about the channel,
     ALL information, channel settings, channel records for users
     EVERYTHING.
     
     *** IMPORTANT ***

     DO NOT use it just to make a bot depart for a channel, that wont 
     work.

     *** IMPORTANT ***
     
     even if you dont have channel-file definied, it will still erase
     all the channel records for users on the next userfile save.
      
     *** IMPORTANT ***
     
     heck! don't use this unless you NEVER want the bot on the channel
     again
