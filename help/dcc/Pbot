%{+B}
###  +bot <bot> <address:botport#[/userport#]>
   creates a user record for a new bot with the nickname given.
   the hostmask table will have one entry ("none"), and the bot
   (b) flag will be set for the user.  the internet address field
   of the user will also be set to the address given.  you can use
   this command and 'chpass' to completely set up a record for a
   future bot, or you can let the two bots negotiate a password
   for themselves the first time they link.  if the bot has a
   seperate port for bots and users they should be seperated with
   a slash (/).
