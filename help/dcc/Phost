###  +host <nickname> <hostmask>
   adds a hostmask to a user's record on the bot.  the hostmasks
   are where the bot will identify that user from.  usually you
   will not need to use this command since a user can add hostmasks
   to her own record via the /MSG IDENT command.  but it's here if
   you need it.
