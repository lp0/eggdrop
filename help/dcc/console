###  console [channel] [modes]
   Changes your console level, so that you will see only those types
   of console messages that you want to.  Your current console channel
   is the channel (that the bot is on) which you can view from the
   party line, and which channel-specific commands (like 'say' and
   'op') take affect on.  valid levels are:
      m  display private msgs/ctcps to the bot
      p  display public talk and ctcps on the channel
      k  display kicks/bans/mode changes on the channel
      j  display joins/parts/nick changes/signoffs/etc on the channel
      b  display bot links/unlinks/userfile-sharing
      s  display server messages and connect/disconnects
      w  display msgs between IRCops (wallops)
%{+m|m}
      c  display user commands (dcc and msg)
      o  display other bot notices [HIGHLY RECOMMENDED]
%{+m}
      x  display file transfers and file-area commands
      d  display debug messages that only coders would care about
%{+n}
      r  display all raw text from the server (if compiled in!)
   (Note that only masters may use 'c', 'x', 'r', 'o', or 'd'.)
   -- There are also 8 user-defined console modes '1' thru '8' --

   The mode can also be a modifier like '+p' or '-jk' or '+mp-b'.  If
   you omit the channel and modes, it will show your current console
   channel and setting.

   be used on users who normally would not be able to set their own
   console mode.
