###  set never-give-up <0/1>
   specifies whether the bot should loop forever.  If never-give-up
   is set false, then the bot will shut down if it goes through the
   entire server list once without getting a connection.  This is to
   keep eggdrop from going through an endless loop, if, for example,
   your machine gets disconnected from the rest of the net.  However,
   some people prefer their bot to never shut down, no matter what.
