###  set greet <0/1>
   specifies whether the bot will automatically "greet" users who
   have specified an info line, when they join the channel.  each
   user can set a sort of "bio" line for themselves using the
   'info' msg command.  if 'greet' is on, when the user joins the
   channel, the bot will send their info line to the channel.  if
   the user's nickname is not in the info line, the bot will add
   it.  if you have set 'use-info' off, this seting is meaningless,
   and users may not set their info anyway.
