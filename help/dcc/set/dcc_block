###  set dcc-block <#>
   specifies the block size to use in DCC file transfers.  the ircII
   client defaults to 512, but admits that it may be too small.  most
   toolboxes set it to 1024.

   you can set this to 0, which turns on "turbo dcc".  in turbo dcc
   mode, the bot will dump transfers as fast as possible, only stopping
   to count acks after it's finished.  this can dramatically improve
   the speed of file transfers, and is recommended.
