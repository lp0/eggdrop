###  (the +c 'common' flag)
   Sometimes a lot of people use irc from the same account, i.e.
   example, a public telnet site.  In that case, many people can
   have the same user@host.  For that reason, they can't use a 
   traditional user record because they will appear to all be 
   the same person.
  
   In such cases, create a user record for the account, and mark
   it +c, or "common access".  Marking it as "common access" means 
   that it shouldn't be used as a definitive address.  When someone 
   introduces themself to the bot (ie, by /msg'ing "hello")and matches 
   as a +c user, they will be given a new user record which identifies 
   them BY NICKNAME.

   Obviously people with that kind of user record shouldn't be given
   much special access, as when they change nicknames the bot
   will identify them as someone else.
