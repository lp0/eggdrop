###  adduser <nickname> [handle]
   creates a new user record for a user on the channel, using their
   current hostname.  it's similar to a user msg'ing the bot 'hello'
   except that no information is sent to that user.  if the bot
   already knows someone by that nickname, and the user on the channel
   doesn't have a bot record, then it does the equivalent of an
   'ident' for that user -- except that, again, no information is
   sent to the user telling them that anything was done.

   if the user is using a different nickname than the bot normally
   knows her by, you can specify her "handle" (the nickname that the
   bot remembers).  got it?  good.
