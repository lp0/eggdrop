###  chattr <nickname> [attributes] [channel]
   Lets you view and change the attributes (flags) field for a user.
   For example, to give Lamer the p and f flags:
      .chattr Lamer +pf
   Or to remove Denali from the global op list:
      .chattr Denali -o
   You may also do any combination of the above:
      .chattr Fred1 -m+xj-o

   You can also change the flags for Usagi on a specific channel by
   supplying the channel after the attributes:
      .chattr Usagi -m+dk-o #blah

   Changing global and channel specific flags within the same command
   line is not (yet) possible.

   Whether or not you change any flags, it will show you the user's
   attributes afterwards.  

   To get a list of the flags possible, do 'help whois'.

   NOTES:

   Only the owner may add or remove the 'n' (owner), 'm' (master), 
   'B' (botnet master), and 's' (bot: userfile share) flags.  

   It is pointless to -n a permanant owner.  You must remove the
   permanant owner in the config file.
