These are the example scripts that come with eggdrop.  They're meant
to be useful AND to introduce Tcl to those who haven't dealt with it
before.  Even people who program in Tcl may be confused by eggdrop's
implementation at first, because so many commands were added to
interface the bot.

action.fix.tcl
   gets rid of those ugly /me's people do instead of a .me.

alltools.tcl
   toolbox.tcl, toolkit.tcl and a few more tools all in 1 file
   toolbox.tcl
      cmwagner's collection of handy proc's
   toolkit.tcl
      a few useful proc's that may be required by other Tcl scripts

botchk
   A shell script which can be used for auto-starting the bot via 'cron'.

getops-1.8.tcl
   a way to get ops from other bots on the botnet (if they're on the
   same channel)
   
ques3.tcl
   makes web pages of who's on each channel, updated periodically
   (requires toolkit.tcl)

userinfo1.0.tcl
   cute user info settings things 
 
wire.tcl
   encrypted communications over a botnet
