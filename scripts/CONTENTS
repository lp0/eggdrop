These are the example scripts that come with eggdrop.  They're meant
to be useful AND to introduce Tcl to those who haven't dealt with it
before.  Even people who program in Tcl may be confused by eggdrop's
implementation at first, because so many commands were added to
interface the bot.

compat.tcl
   compatability script for really old eggdrop versions

console.tcl
   saves and restores users' console levels

dike.tcl
   detects floodnet attacks and puts offending floodnet members on
   ignore, while sharing the floodnet hostmasks with other bots on
   your botnet (good example of botnet coordination)

gainops1.tcl
   a way to get ops from other bots on the botnet (if they're on the
   same channel)

local.tcl
   uses the FILT binding to send text starting with ' to local users
   only (not the rest of the botnet)

ques3.tcl
   makes web pages of who's on each channel, updated periodically
   (requires toolkit.tcl)

samples.tcl
   adds several commands (more good examples)

toolkit.tcl
   a few useful proc's that may be required by other Tcl scripts

toolbox.tcl
   cmwagner's collection of handy proc's

wire.tcl
   encrypted communications over a botnet

----------------------------------------------------------------------

There is also one ircII script here:

ntalk.irc
   ntalk v4, which makes dcc chats with eggdrops look nice

----------------------------------------------------------------------

There is one stand-alone Tcl script:

weed
   a simple script to clear out old or unwanted users from your
   userfile

----------------------------------------------------------------------

And there is one sample eggdrop config:

gaysf
   a bot "Lamerbot" which stays in the shadows, only giving ops to those
   who ask, and not getting involved in channel politics
