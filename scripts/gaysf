# This is a sample config file for a bot that would sit on "#gaysf" and
# do nothing except op people who asked for ops (and who had been given
# +o).  It's an example of how to config a bot to be mostly transparent,
# instead of dictating channel politics (like, for example, the #gaysex
# bots).
#
# There are not as many comments in this file, because 'eggdrop.conf' has
# all the tutorial stuff.  This is meant to look more like a bot config
# that might actually be in use.
