BUG REPORTS: 
=== =======
(i.e. things that are broke, but aren't getting fixed anytime soon)

* ---ALL--- tcl8.0 versions WILL crash, including 8.0b2. 
  - 8.0release look ok (maybe..DOH! maybe NOT! 1 instance !!)
* Solve to non-working alarm(10) in linux (calls to gethostbyaddr/name()
  have blocked for long periods when bind/named doesn't resolve quickly,
  and the alarm does not interrupt it).
* High-bit characters are being filtered from channel names.   This is
  a fault of the TCL interpreter, and not eggdrop.  The TCL interpreter
  filters the characters when it reads a file for interpreting.
